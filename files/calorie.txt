Build a single-user calories and macros tracker web app using React / Next.js.
No backend. No authentication.
All user data must be stored in browser localStorage.
Nutrition data should be fetched from a free food nutrition API.

Core Requirements
1. App Purpose

Track daily:

Calories

Protein

Carbs

Fat

Support Indian food by allowing:

API-based food search

Manual custom food entries

2. Tech Constraints

Frontend only (React or Next.js)

No backend, no database

Use localStorage for:

Daily food logs

Custom foods

User calorie & protein goals

Use a public nutrition API (example: CalorieNinjas or Nutritionix)

API key should be stored in environment variables

UI Pages / Sections
3. Main Dashboard (Home)

Show:

Selected date (default: today)

Total calories consumed

Total protein, carbs, fats

Daily calorie goal

Remaining calories

Remaining protein

Include:

Progress bar for calories

Progress bar for protein

Color logic:

Green = within target

Yellow = close to limit

Red = exceeded

4. Meal Sections

Meals:

Breakfast

Lunch

Dinner

Snacks

Each meal should:

Show foods added

Show total calories per meal

Allow deleting individual food items

Food Logging
5. Add Food Flow

User flow:

Select meal

Search food using API OR add custom food

Enter quantity

Save food

6. API Food Search

Search food by text (example: “banana”, “rice”, “boiled egg”)

Display:

Calories per serving

Protein, carbs, fat

Allow user to select item and quantity

Scale nutrition values based on quantity

7. Custom Food Entry (Important)

Allow user to add custom foods manually with:

Food name

Calories per unit

Protein per unit

Carbs per unit

Fat per unit

Unit label (roti, bowl, cup, piece)

Custom foods must:

Be saved in localStorage

Be reusable in future searches

Portion Handling
8. Quantity Support

Allow decimal quantities (0.5, 1.5, 2)

Automatically calculate scaled macros

Example:

1 roti = 120 kcal

2 rotis = 240 kcal

Date-Based Tracking
9. Date Selector

User can switch dates

Each date has its own food log

Data structure in localStorage should be date-keyed

Example:

{
  "2026-02-03": {
    "breakfast": [],
    "lunch": [],
    "dinner": [],
    "snacks": []
  }
}

Local Storage Management
10. localStorage Data

Store:

Daily logs

Custom food list

User settings (calorie goal, protein goal)

Persist data across refresh and browser restarts.

Settings
11. Settings Panel

Allow user to set:

Daily calorie target

Daily protein target

Default units

Reset all data option

Store settings in localStorage.

UX Rules
12. Speed & Simplicity

Food should be addable in under 10 seconds

Minimal clicks

Keyboard friendly

Mobile responsive

Error Handling
13. API Errors

Gracefully handle API failure

Show message like:

“API unavailable. Add food manually.”

Optional Enhancements (Only if time permits)

Recent foods list

Favorite foods

Weekly average calories view

Dark mode toggle

Design Guidelines

Clean, minimal UI

Focus on readability

No clutter

Use cards for meals

Sticky “Add Food” button

Output Expectation

Fully working frontend app

Clean component structure

Clear comments in code

No backend code

No authentication
